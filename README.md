# Infomation Gathering
Get your version

>Enter chrome://version/
>Look next to "Google Chrome" at the top for version
>Look at "Platform" and at the end of the same line there should be a word like "nissa" or "dedede"

Nissa is the most common as far as I know.

# Chromebook Info Lookup
Lookup details about your computer: [ChromeOS Lookup](https://cros.tech/)
Look at the bottom of your computer for type.
The format is something like this: HP Fortis 14 inch G11 Chromebook (My Chromebook Type)
That chromebook type would be searched up on the ChromeOS Lookup.
That Chromebook type's page is: [HP Fortis 14 inch G11 Chromebook Page](https://cros.tech/device/yavijo/)
