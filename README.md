# Straight to the Point
For a full tutorial on **shimboot** go to the [Shimboot Tutorial](shimboot.md)

UPDATE: Shimboot has not worked on HP Fortis 14 G11 Chromebook in South County Middle School (FCPS)

**WARNING: Shimboot is not for beginners. It may break your computer if done improperly. Have some terminal and USB experience before attempting this.**


# Infomation Gathering
Get your version

>Enter chrome://version/

>Look next to "Google Chrome" at the top for version

>Look at "Platform" and at the end of the same line there should be a word like "**nissa**" or "**dedede**"

Nissa is the most common as far as I know.

# Chromebook Info Lookup

Lookup details about your computer: [ChromeOS Lookup](https://cros.tech/)

Look at the bottom of your computer for type.

The format is something like this: *HP Fortis 14 inch G11 Chromebook* (My Chromebook Type)

That chromebook type would be searched up on the ChromeOS Lookup.

That Chromebook type's page is: [HP Fortis 14 inch G11 Chromebook Page](https://cros.tech/device/yavijo/)

# Recovery Images

Once you are on your Chromebook's page, you can download recovery images.

From my knowledge, **Stable** is the main version.

**Dev** is the experimental build, but should give more access to the device than Stable
